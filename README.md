# Turkish Forensic Medicine Assistant - RAG

The Forensic Medicine Assistant is a question-answering system designed for use in the field of forensic medicine. It leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, to provide users with accurate and relevant answers to their questions.

## Overview

This project utilizes a combination of text retrieval and text generation methods to handle user queries. First, it retrieves relevant information from a large corpus of forensic medicine documents using vector similarity search techniques. Then, it generates responses to user questions based on the retrieved information using a language model.
